    "I'm a software engineer based in Astana, Kazakhstan. My main focus is web development with a strong background in backend, but over the past few years I’ve been actively building up my frontend skills - especially with React - to better understand the full development cycle and work confidently across the stack.",
    "Right now, I’m focused on continuous learning: taking online courses, exploring modern technologies, and studying best development practices. I’m particularly interested in projects where architecture, code quality, and thoughtful user experience matter.",
    "Outside of development, I focus on continuous learning - reading technical and fiction books, and listening to podcasts in English to grow both professionally and personally.",
    "I'm open to new opportunities and looking for a team where I can apply my skills in both frontend and backend, continue to grow, and contribute real value to the product. If you're looking for a flexible and motivated developer - I’d love to connect!"
